 While analyzing my reverse function, I believe my function is O(N) because there are multiple operations going on in this function. This function is reversing the nodes so n = the amount of nodes in the list that we want to reverse. 

 The complexity of this function is:
 T(n) 
 = T(n - 1) + O(1) / T(n - 1) 
 
 T(n) = n * O(1) + T(0) 
 = n * O(1) + O(1)
 = O(n)
