Time complexity of the clear() function of Stack

To implement the stack I used a list for my data structure/container. 
To create the clear() function of the stack, I used the List built-in function
clear() to clear the object of the stack. This clear function of the 
List class iterates through each item and then deletes them. Therefore
the time complexity is O(N).
