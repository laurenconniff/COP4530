 The worst-case time complexity of the private member function makeEmpty(BinaryNode* & t) 
 of the binary expression tree is O(N). This is because the function must travel through 
 the tree from each node, starting at the root. It then deletes each node while moving back 
 up through the tree. Since it is passing through and then delete each seperate node, the 
 function can be considered a O(N) because of the traveling and then this one operation of 
 deletion of each.
